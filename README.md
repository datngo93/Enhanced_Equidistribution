# Enhanced_Equidistribution

## Summary
This is a MATLAB source code of the enhanced equidistribution, which guarantees that the generated random sequence follows the theoretical uniform distribution. The figure below depicts the histograms of random numbers drawn from the standard uniform distribution, equidistribution, and enhanced equidistribution, respectively. It can be observed that the enhanced equidistribution assembled the theoretical uniform distribution better than other two methods.
